# Rejection Sampling

I applied a uniform distribution for my function by using of rejection sampling and then visualized the output.
In this experiment, rejection sampling is used for generating sample from an arbitrary probability function like: f(x) = 1.2 - x**4
between 0 and 1. 
We run two batch samples with 1000 proposals.
For sample a Gaussian distribution, our normalized probability density function is f(x)=exp(-pi * x**2)

To run it:
